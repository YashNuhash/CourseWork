# YouTube Script: XOR - Real-time Code Collaboration Made Easy

## Intro (1 minute)
"Hey everyone! What's up? Today I'm super excited to show you something I've been working on - it's called XOR, a real-time code collaboration tool. You know those moments when you're trying to debug with your teammate and sharing code is a mess? Yeah, XOR solves that. Let me show you how it works!

## Landing Page (1-2 minutes)
[Show landing page with animations]
"Check this out - first thing you'll notice is this sick Google Gemini-style animation. Pretty cool, right? I spent a good amount of time making this look smooth. The whole UI is dark-themed because, let's be honest, who codes in light mode? üòÑ

And look at this 'Start Collaborating' button - the way it floats over the animation, that's some nice depth there.

## Getting Started (1-2 minutes)
"Alright, let's jump in! All you need to do is:
- Click this 'Start Collaborating' button
- Type in your name
- Boom! You get a room ID

Super simple, no signup needed. Share this room ID with your friend and you're ready to code together!

## Live Demo (2-3 minutes)
[Open two browser windows side by side]
"Now here's where it gets interesting. I'm gonna open another browser to show you how this works in real-time. 

Let's write some code... [Start typing in one window]
Look at that - instant sync! Whatever I type here shows up immediately in the other window. No lag, no delays.

And check out these language options:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- HTML/CSS
And more... all with proper syntax highlighting!

## Cool Features (2 minutes)
"But wait, there's more! Let me show you some features I'm really proud of:

1. Look at these profile avatars - you can see who's in the room
2. Copy room ID with one click
3. This sick blur effect when you scroll [demonstrate navbar blur]
4. And my favorite - real-time code sync with zero delay

## Technical Bits (1 minute)
"For the nerds out there wondering how this works:
- Frontend: Next.js and TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Socket.IO for that sweet real-time action
- UI: Tailwind CSS because, come on, it's awesome
- All hosted on Vercel and Render

## Wrapping Up (1 minute)
"And that's XOR! Pretty cool, right? You can try it out right now at xor-code.vercel.app. Perfect for:
- Pair programming
- Code reviews
- Teaching coding
- Or just vibing with your coding buddies

Don't forget to check out the repo on GitHub, and let me know what features you'd like to see next!
