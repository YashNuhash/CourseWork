The Internet model (also called the **TCP/IP model**) has **five layers**:

1. **Physical Layer**
2. **Data Link Layer**
3. **Network Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Application Layer**

---

### **2. Which layers in the Internet model are the network support layers?**

The **network support layers** are the layers that help in **moving data from one device to another** through the network.
These are:

1. **Physical Layer**
2. **Data Link Layer**
3. **Network Layer**

These layers are responsible for handling hardware, signals, routing, and data transmission.

### **4. What is the difference between network layer delivery and transport layer delivery?**


| **Aspect**              | **Network Layer Delivery**                            | **Transport Layer Delivery**                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type of Delivery**    | Host-to-Host                                          | Process-to-Process                                         |
| **Main Responsibility** | Delivers data to the correct **destination computer** | Delivers data to the correct **application/process**       |
| **Address Used**        | IP Address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)                        | Port Number (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 25 for Email)              |
| **Example**             | Sending data from your PC to a web server             | Sending data to the browser (not email app) on that server |
| **Protocol Example**    | IP (Internet Protocol)                                | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP                   |



Here are the easy and descriptive answers to your next **Data Communication and Networking** questions:

---

### **5. What is a peer-to-peer process?**

A **peer-to-peer process** means **communication between the same layers on different devices** (computers).

üîπ For example:
When the **Transport Layer** of one computer sends data, it communicates directly with the **Transport Layer** of the other computer.

‚úÖ **In short**:
Each layer communicates only with its **peer** on the other side.

---

### **6. How does information get passed from one layer to the next in the Internet model?**

In the Internet model:

* Data **moves downward** from the top layer (Application Layer) to the bottom (Physical Layer) **when sending**.
* Data **moves upward** from the bottom layer to the top **when receiving**.

At each layer:

* A **header** is added to the data (if needed).
* When data is received, each layer **removes its own header** before passing it to the upper layer.

üîΩ **Sending:** Application ‚Üí Transport ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Data Link ‚Üí Physical
üîº **Receiving:** Physical ‚Üí Data Link ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Transport ‚Üí Application

### **7. What are headers and trailers, and how do they get added and removed?**

| **Item**    | **What It Is**                                           | **When It Is Used**                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header**  | Extra information added **at the beginning** of the data | Added by each layer (except Physical) when sending          |
| **Trailer** | Extra information added **at the end** of the data       | Usually added by **Data Link Layer** (e.g., error checking) |

‚úÖ **How They Work:**

* **When sending:**
  Each layer adds a **header** (and maybe trailer) to help the next layer understand the data.

* **When receiving:**
  Each layer removes its **own header/trailer**, then sends the remaining data to the upper layer.

üì¶ **Think of it like packing a gift**:
Each layer wraps the gift (data) with its own box (header/trailer). At the destination, each layer unwraps its box.

üõ†Ô∏è **Main responsibilities:**

1. **Segmentation and reassembly** ‚Äì Dividing data into small pieces (segments) and combining them again at the receiver.
2. **Port addressing** ‚Äì Using port numbers to identify the source and destination applications.
3. **Connection control** ‚Äì Establishing, maintaining, and ending connections (TCP).
4. **Flow control** ‚Äì Preventing the sender from overwhelming the receiver.
5. **Error control** ‚Äì Making sure data arrives correctly (retransmitting lost or damaged data).

‚úÖ In short:
The transport layer makes sure that data goes **reliably** and **in order** between apps on different devices.

| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Port Address**     | Transport Layer | Identifies **specific application** on a device | Port 80 (HTTP), Port 25 (Email)     |
| **Logical Address**  | Network Layer   | Identifies a **device on a network**            | IP address: 192.168.1.5             |
| **Physical Address** | Data Link Layer | Identifies a **device on a local network**      | MAC address: A1\:B2\:C3\:D4\:E5\:F6 |

‚úÖ **In easy words**:

* **Port Address** = Door number in a house (which app to talk to).
* **Logical Address** = House address (which device on the internet).
* **Physical Address** = Name tag on the device (used inside the local network).

Here‚Äôs a **simple and descriptive explanation** of a **sine wave** and its fundamental properties ‚Äî perfect for your **Data Communication and Networking exam**.

---

## ‚úÖ **What is a Sine Wave?**

A **sine wave** is a **smooth, periodic (repeating)** wave that represents a **continuous signal**.
It is the most **basic form of an analog signal**.

üìà It looks like a **smooth up-and-down curve**, just like waves in the ocean.

In data communication, **sine waves are used to represent and carry analog signals** (such as voice, radio, or TV signals).

---

### üîÅ **Mathematical form:**

$$
y(t) = A \cdot \sin(2\pi f t + \phi)
$$

Where:

* **A** = Amplitude
* **f** = Frequency (in Hz)
* **t** = Time
* **œÜ** (phi) = Phase shift

## ‚úÖ **Fundamental Properties of a Sine Wave**

| **Property**     | **Meaning**                      | **Explanation (Simple)**                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Amplitude** | Height of the wave               | Shows the **strength** or **loudness** of the signal. More amplitude = stronger signal. |
| **2. Frequency** | Number of cycles per second (Hz) | How **fast** the wave repeats in one second. Higher frequency = more cycles per second. |
| **3. Period**    | Time for one complete cycle      | Period = 1 / Frequency. If frequency is 2 Hz, period is 0.5 seconds.                    |
| **4. Phase**     | Position of the wave             | It tells how much the wave is **shifted left or right** from the origin.                |

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

If a sine wave has:

* Amplitude = 5V
* Frequency = 50 Hz
* Phase = 0¬∞

Then it completes **50 cycles every second**, reaches a maximum of **+5V**, a minimum of **‚Äì5V**, and starts from 0 with **no shift**.
