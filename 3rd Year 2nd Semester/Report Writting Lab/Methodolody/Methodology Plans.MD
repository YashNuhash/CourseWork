# üìå Methodology Steps

### **1. Dataset Preparation**

* Collect **BanFakeNews** dataset (and optionally augment with other Bangla news sources).
* Pre-processing:

  * Normalize Bangla text (remove punctuation, stop words, normalize Unicode).
  * Tokenize Bangla sentences/words.
  * Split into **train/validation/test** sets.

---

### **2. Feature Engineering**

* **Psycholinguistic Features** (LIWC-style categories adapted for Bangla):

  * Emotion words (positive, negative, anger, fear, trust).
  * Certainty & uncertainty markers (‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶®, ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶§‡ßã, ‡¶Ö‡¶¨‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶á, ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶ö‡¶ø‡¶§).
  * Persuasion indicators (e.g., rhetorical questions, exaggerations).
* **Discourse Features**:

  * Coreference chains (tracking pronouns like ‡¶∏‡ßá, ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ).
  * Topic flow (e.g., entity mentions and transitions).
  * Discourse markers (‡¶§‡¶¨‡ßá, ‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡ßÅ, ‡¶Ø‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶ì).
* Represent them as **numeric feature vectors**.

---

### **3. Embedding & Representation**

* Use **Bangla BERT / mBERT / IndicBERT** embeddings.
* Combine embeddings with psycholinguistic + discourse features ‚Üí **hybrid feature vector**.

---

### **4. Model Building**

* Baseline: Logistic Regression, SVM, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM.
* Proposed Model:

  * Transformer (BanglaBERT fine-tuned)
  * * Feature fusion layer (concatenate embeddings + discourse features + psycholinguistic features).
* Output: Binary classification (Fake vs. Real).

---

### **5. Training & Validation**

* Use **cross-validation (5-fold or 10-fold)**.
* Hyperparameter tuning: learning rate, dropout, hidden size.
* Optimization: Adam optimizer.

---

### **6. Evaluation Metrics**

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-score
* ROC-AUC curve
* Confusion Matrix (to see class imbalance effects).
* Possibly: Explainability score (feature importance visualization).

# üìå Results & Analysis Steps

### **1. Baseline Performance**

* Show results of **classical ML (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)** with n-gram/TF-IDF features.
* Compare against **RNN, CNN, LSTM** baseline results.

---

### **2. Proposed Model Performance**

* Show improvements with **BanglaBERT + discourse + psycholinguistic features**.
* Present:

  * Table of metric scores (Accuracy, F1, etc.).
  * Bar chart comparing methods.

---

### **3. Error Analysis**

* Misclassified examples:

  * Why some fake news looked real? (e.g., formal tone, political bias).
  * Why some real news looked fake? (e.g., sensational headlines).
* Case studies:

  * Show actual Bangla news snippets and explain classification errors.

---

### **4. Ablation Study**

* Remove one component at a time:

  * Only embeddings (no psycholinguistics).
  * Only embeddings + discourse.
  * Full hybrid model.
* Show how each component contributes to accuracy.

---

### **5. Human Interpretability**

* Visualize **important psycholinguistic cues** (e.g., frequent use of fear/uncertainty words in fake news).
* Discuss **discourse coherence differences** in real vs. fake news.

---

### **6. Discussion**

* Compare results with **English fake news studies** ‚Üí does Bangla behave similarly?
* Highlight strengths:

  * Better interpretability.
  * Culturally adapted features.
* Mention limitations:

  * Dataset size.
  * Coverage of dialects.
  * Need for multimodal data (text + image + audio).
