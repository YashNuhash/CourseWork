#### Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Title**: "System Design Blueprint: Optimizing Hybrid Satellite Internet for Rural Bangladesh"
- **Description**: Welcome to our design phase presentation! This slide introduces our project, showcasing the "Optimized Hybrid Satellite Internet System for Low-Latency Rural Connectivity." It includes the team name, date (August 27, 2025), and a visual of a satellite, ground station, and local network to hint at the hybrid approach. Let’s dive into designing a solution for rural Bangladesh!

#### Slide 2: Agenda
- **Title**: "Agenda: Designing Our Hybrid System"
- **Description**: This slide outlines what we’ll cover: an overview of the hybrid system, network architecture, hardware and software needs, data flow and security, scalability and phased rollout, and a conclusion with next steps. It’s a roadmap to keep us on track as we design this system!

#### Slide 3: Project Overview
- **Title**: "Recap: Why We’re Here"
- **Description**: Let’s revisit why we’re designing this—rural Bangladesh needs fast, low-latency internet (< 25 ms) to boost education and jobs. We’ve confirmed it’s feasible with LEO satellites, ground stations, CDNs, and laser links. This slide recaps our goals and sets the stage for the design details ahead.

#### Slide 4: Hybrid System Overview
- **Title**: "What Makes It Hybrid?"
- **Description**: Here, we explain our hybrid magic! It blends LEO satellites for wide coverage, ground stations as internet gateways, CDNs at local spots for fast data, and laser links between satellites for efficiency. This slide uses simple diagrams to show how these parts work together to solve rural connectivity challenges.

#### Slide 5: Network Architecture
- **Title**: "Building the Network Layout"
- **Description**: This slide lays out our network plan. We’ll show a map of Bangladesh with satellite orbits, ground station locations (starting with a few key areas), and CDN spots. It highlights how data moves from user dishes to satellites, then to ground stations or local CDNs, ensuring low latency and wide reach.

#### Slide 6: Hardware and Software Requirements
- **Title**: "Gear and Tools We Need"
- **Description**: Let’s talk gear! This slide lists user terminals (dishes), rugged ground station equipment for monsoons, CDN servers for local data, and software for managing laser links. We’ll also mention weather-proofing features to keep everything running smoothly in Bangladesh’s climate.

#### Slide 7: Data Flow and Security
- **Title**: "How Data Moves and Stays Safe"
- **Description**: This slide walks through data’s journey—from users to satellites, then to ground stations or CDNs, and back. We’ll include a simple flow chart and stress that encryption keeps everything secure, meeting BTRC rules and protecting rural users’ privacy.

#### Slide 8: Scalability and Phased Rollout
- **Title**: "Growing Smart and Steady"
- **Description**: We’re planning big but starting small! This slide shows our phased approach: first, a pilot with a few CDNs and one ground station, then expanding as we get more users. It also covers how we’ll scale satellites and stations to cover more rural areas over time.

#### Slide 9: Challenges and Mitigations
- **Title**: "Tackling the Tough Stuff"
- **Description**: Let’s be real—challenges like monsoon weather, high costs, and limited ground sites exist. This slide outlines how we’ll use tough hardware, phased spending, and local partnerships to overcome these, keeping our design on track for Bangladesh.

#### Slide 10: Conclusion and Next Steps
- **Title**: "Wrapping Up and Moving Forward"
- **Description**: We’ve designed a hybrid system to bring fast internet to rural Bangladesh! This slide sums up our blueprint’s key points—low latency, cost management, and scalability—and outlines next steps: testing the pilot in six months and preparing for development. Any thoughts?

#### Slide 11: Q&A
- **Title**: "Questions and Answers"
- **Description**: This is your chance to ask anything! We’ll open the floor to discuss the design, address concerns, and gather feedback to refine our plan before moving to the development phase.

### Implementation Notes
- **Visual Design**: Use simple icons (e.g., satellites, towers, servers) and color-code sections (e.g., green for solutions, yellow for challenges). Keep text big and clear (18–24pt font).
- **Timing**: Aim for 5–7 minutes total, with 30–45 seconds per slide, leaving time for Q&A.
- **Backup**: Save each slide as a PNG or PDF to avoid tech glitches during the presentation.
