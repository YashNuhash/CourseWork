# 🚀 Project Pitch Deck

## Project Title:

**Optimized Hybrid Satellite Internet Model for Low-Latency Rural Connectivity**

---

## 📈 Problem Statement

* Over 2.7 billion people lack reliable internet access, primarily in rural areas.
* Starlink provides LEO satellite coverage, but 1 terminal per household is costly and inefficient.
* Rural schools, hospitals, and villages often lack power, structured networking, or tech support.

---

## 🛍️ Target Users

* Rural Schools and Students
* Village Health Clinics
* NGOs and Disaster Response Units
* Local Governments in Developing Regions

---

## 🌐 Our Solution

> A **hybrid internet system** using a **single Starlink terminal** as backhaul, connected to a **local mesh distribution system** powered by outdoor Wi-Fi routers, solar backups, and optional edge caching.

---

## 🔌 Key Features

* **Starlink Gateway Node** for satellite uplink
* **Mesh Wi-Fi Distribution** using PoE-enabled routers
* **Local Edge Caching** to save bandwidth and reduce latency
* **Solar/Battery Power Support** for off-grid setups
* **Dashboard Monitoring Panel** for administrators

## ⚡ Impact Metrics

| Metric         | Traditional Starlink         | Hybrid Model                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cost per user  | \$599 hardware + \$120/month | \$25/user (shared terminal)   |
| Latency (avg)  | 40-60ms                      | 10-20ms locally + 40ms uplink |
| Power required | 100% AC grid                 | Hybrid (solar-ready)          |
| Uptime         | Limited in weather           | Resilient w/ edge failover    |
