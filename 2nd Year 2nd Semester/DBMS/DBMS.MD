# [Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics-of-functional-dependencies-and-normalization-for-relational-databases)

## Introduction
Functional dependencies and normalization are important concepts in relational database design. A functional dependency occurs when the value of one attribute determines the value of another attribute. Normalization is the process of organizing a database in a way that reduces redundancy and dependency. It is a crucial step in designing an efficient and effective database structure.

## What are functional dependencies?
Functional dependencies are relationships between attributes in a database. They describe how one attribute is dependent on another attribute. For example, consider a database of employee records. The employee's ID number might be functionally dependent on their name because the name determines the ID number. In this case, we would say that the ID number is functionally dependent on the name.

Functional dependencies can be used to design a database in a way that eliminates redundancy and ensures data integrity. For example, consider a database that stores employee records and the departments they work in. If we store the department name for each employee, we might end up with several copies of the same department name.

This would be redundant and would take up unnecessary space in the database. Instead, we can use functional dependencies to store the department name only once and use the employee's ID number to determine which department they work in. This reduces redundancy and makes the database more efficient.

## Why is Normalization Important?
Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It is important because it helps to eliminate data inconsistencies and ensures that the data is stored in a logical and organized way.

For example, consider a database that stores customer information and the products they have purchased. If we store the product names with each customer record, we might end up with several copies of the same product name. This would be redundant and would take up unnecessary space in the database. Instead, we can use normalization to create a separate table for products and store the product names only once. This reduces redundancy and makes the database more efficient.

There are several normal forms that can be used to normalize a database. The most common normal forms are the first, second, and third normal forms.

## First normal form (1NF)
The first normal form (1NF) is a basic level of normalization. To be in 1NF, a table must meet the following criteria −

It must contain only atomic values. An atomic value is a single value that cannot be further broken down. For example, a name is an atomic value, but an address is not because it can be broken down into separate values for the street, city, state, and zip code.

It must not contain repeating groups. A repeating group is a set of values that are repeated within a single record. For example, if a table contains a field for phone numbers, it should not contain multiple phone numbers within the same field. Instead, there should be separate fields for each phone number.

## Second normal form (2NF)
The second normal form (2NF) is a higher level of normalization. To be in 2NF, a table must meet the following criteria −
>> 
> It must be in 1NF.
>
>It must not have any partial dependencies. A partial dependency occurs when a non-key attribute is dependent on only a part of the primary key. For example, consider a table with the following attributes: EmployeeID (primary key), EmployeeName, and DepartmentID. If the DepartmentID is dependent on the EmployeeID, but not on the EmployeeName, there is a partial dependency. To eliminate this dependency, we would create a separate table for departments and store the DepartmentID and DepartmentName in that table.

## Third normal form (3NF)
The third normal form (3NF) is a higher level of normalization. To be in 3NF, a table must meet the following criteria −
>>
> It must be in 2NF.
>
> It must not have any transitive dependencies. A transitive dependency occurs when an attribute is dependent on another attribute that is not the primary key. For example, consider a table with the following attributes: EmployeeID (primary key), EmployeeName, and ManagerID. If the ManagerID is dependent on the EmployeeID, which is the primary key, there is no transitive dependency. However, if the ManagerID is dependent on the EmployeeName, which is not the primary key, there is a transitive dependency. To eliminate this dependency, we would create a separate table for managers and store the ManagerID and ManagerName in that table.

### Real-life Examples
To better understand these concepts, let's look at some real-life examples of functional dependencies and normalization.

### Example 1
Consider a database of customer orders for an online store. The following table stores information about each order −

![Table1](image.png)

In this table, the OrderID is the primary key and the CustomerID and ProductID are foreign keys. The Quantity attribute is dependent on the OrderID, because it determines the quantity of each product in the order.

This table is in 1NF because it contains only atomic values and does not have any repeating groups. However, it is not in 2NF because the Quantity attribute is dependent on the OrderID, which is only a part of the primary key (OrderID, ProductID). To eliminate this partial dependency, we can create a separate table for order details and store the OrderID, ProductID, and Quantity in that table.

### Example 2
Consider a database of employee records for a company. The following table stores information about each employee −

![Table3](image-2.png)

In this table, the EmployeeID is the primary key and the ManagerID and DepartmentID are foreign keys. The ManagerID is dependent on the EmployeeID, because it determines the employee's manager. The DepartmentID is dependent on the ManagerID, because it determines the department the employee works in.

This table is in 2NF because it is in 1NF and does not have any partial dependencies. However, it is not in 3NF because the DepartmentID is dependent on the ManagerID, which is not the primary key. To eliminate this transitive dependency, we can create a separate table for departments and store the DepartmentID and DepartmentName in that table. We can then update the employees table to store the DepartmentID as a foreign key.

### Conclusion:
Functional dependencies and normalization are important concepts in relational database design. They help to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity by organizing the database in a logical and efficient way. By understanding these concepts and applying them to your database design, you can create a database that is efficient, effective, and easy to maintain.

## Relational Database Design Pitfalls and Solutions Through Normalization


When designing relational databases, certain pitfalls can lead to issues like data redundancy, anomalies, and inefficient performance. **Normalization** is a process used to structure a database to avoid these pitfalls by organizing data into logically related tables. Here are some common database design pitfalls and how normalization can address them.

---

## 1. Data Redundancy and Inconsistency

- **Pitfall**: Storing the same information in multiple places within a database leads to redundancy. For example, if customer details (e.g., name and address) are repeated in every order record, updating a customer's address requires updating it in multiple rows, which can lead to inconsistencies if one record is missed.
  
- **Solution**: **First Normal Form (1NF)** and **Second Normal Form (2NF)**
  - **1NF**: Ensures that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values and each row is unique. This removes duplicate columns and helps with organizing data into rows and columns.
  - **2NF**: Removes partial dependencies, meaning that non-key attributes should not depend on part of a composite primary key. By separating customer details into a different table and linking it with a unique customer ID, we reduce redundancy.
  
- **Example**: Separate `Customers` and `Orders` tables so that customer information is stored in one place, and orders reference customers via a foreign key.

---

## 2. Update Anomalies

- **Pitfall**: When the same information is stored in multiple rows, updates to data can become inconsistent. For instance, if an employee's department name is stored in multiple rows, updating the department name in one row and not others creates inconsistency.
  
- **Solution**: **Second Normal Form (2NF)**
  - Ensures that non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key. By organizing related information into separate tables, update anomalies are minimized.
  
- **Example**: Separate `Employees` and `Departments` tables, linking them by a foreign key. If a department name changes, it only needs to be updated in one place.

---

## 3. Insertion Anomalies

- **Pitfall**: Insertion anomalies occur when certain data cannot be added to the database without the presence of additional, possibly unnecessary data. For example, if a database requires both student and course information to create a record, a new student who hasn't enrolled in any course cannot be added to the database.

- **Solution**: **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
  - **3NF** removes transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depending on other non-key attributes). This reduces insertion anomalies by allowing independent entries without requiring unrelated information.
  
- **Example**: Separate `Students` and `Courses` tables so that students can be added without requiring course enrollment data, and vice versa.

---

## 4. Deletion Anomalies

- **Pitfall**: Deletion anomalies happen when deleting a record unintentionally removes additional data. For instance, if student course enrollment data is stored in a single table, deleting the last course enrollment for a student could also delete their personal information.

- **Solution**: **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
  - By creating separate tables for entities with distinct meanings, deleting a record does not result in the unintended loss of related information.
  
- **Example**: Use a separate `Enrollment` table to connect `Students` and `Courses`, allowing individual records to be deleted without impacting other data.

---

## 5. Dependency on Non-Key Attributes

- **Pitfall**: In a poorly structured table, non-key attributes may depend on each other rather than on the primary key, causing unnecessary dependencies and duplication. For instance, if a “Sales” table stores salesperson information along with each sale, it introduces dependency on non-key attributes.

- **Solution**: **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**
  - BCNF further refines 3NF by ensuring that every determinant is a candidate key, thereby removing dependencies between non-key attributes.
  
- **Example**: Separate `Sales` and `Salespersons` tables to prevent dependency on non-key attributes, allowing sales data to be stored independently of salesperson details.

---

## 6. Complex Relationships and Many-to-Many Relationships

- **Pitfall**: Many-to-many relationships can lead to data duplication and complex queries. For instance, storing both course and student data in a single table for a many-to-many relationship creates redundant information and difficult maintenance.

- **Solution**: **Junction Tables in Normalization**
  - Use a junction table to manage many-to-many relationships. This reduces duplication and simplifies data retrieval.
  
- **Example**: For a student-course relationship, create a `Student_Course` junction table with `Student ID` and `Course ID` as foreign keys, which helps in managing enrollments without redundant information.

## Summary of Normal Forms and Their Benefits

- **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Eliminates duplicate columns and ensures atomic values. Reduces redundancy and makes data easier to manage.
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Eliminates partial dependencies and ensures full dependency on the primary key, reducing update and insertion anomalies.
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Eliminates transitive dependencies, further reducing redundancy and ensuring logical data organization.
- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: Ensures every determinant is a candidate key, minimizing dependency issues.
  
Normalization, when applied correctly, creates a database design that minimizes redundancy, ensures data integrity, and optimizes storage and query performance.
