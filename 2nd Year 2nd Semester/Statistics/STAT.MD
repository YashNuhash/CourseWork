## Solution for Q1: 

### (a) **Define population, sample, experiment parameter, and statistic with suitable examples.**

- **Population**: The entire group of individuals or items under study.  
  *Example*: All students in a university.  

- **Sample**: A subset of the population selected for the study.  
  *Example*: 200 students selected randomly from the university.  

- **Experiment parameter**: A numerical value that describes a characteristic of the population, such as the population mean or proportion.  
  *Example*: The true average height of all students in the university.  

- **Statistic**: A numerical value calculated from the sample data to estimate the parameter.  
  *Example*: The average height of the 200 sampled students.

### (b) **Define variables and discuss their types with examples.**

- **Variables**: Characteristics or properties that can vary among individuals in a population or sample.  

**Types of variables:**
1. **Qualitative (Categorical)**: Non-numeric variables representing categories.  
   *Example*: Eye color (e.g., brown, blue, green).  

2. **Quantitative (Numerical)**: Numeric variables that can be measured.  
   - **Discrete**: Countable values.  
     *Example*: Number of books a student has (e.g., 1, 2, 3).  
   - **Continuous**: Measurable and can take any value within a range.  
     *Example*: Height of students (e.g., 5.6 ft, 5.7 ft).

### (c) **Solution:**

#### Given Data:
Political parties: A, B, C, D  
Survey size: 50 people  

The data collected is:  
B, C, A, B, A, C, D, A, A, B, C, A, B, C, D, A, A, B, C, A, A, B, D, A, B, D, A, B, B, D, A, C, B, A, A, B, D, C, A, B, A, D, C, A, B, A, C, B, A, D.

#### Steps to Solve:

 **Frequency Distribution Table**

| Party | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| A     | 19        |
| B     | 14        |
| C     | 9         |
| D     | 8         |

---

#### (i) **Most Popular Party**  
The most popular party is **Party A**, with 19 votes.

---

#### (ii) **Percent of People Liked Party B**

# Question 2:

(a) Define central tendency. What are the important measures of central tendency? Which one is best and why?

(b) The following frequency table relates to the marks obtained by 50 students in a course of statistics:

| Marks | No. of Students |
|---|---|
| 0-15 | 2 |
| 15-30 | 10 |
| 30-45 | 20 |
| 45-60 | 10 |
| 60-75 | 5 |
| 75-90 | 3 |

(i) Calculate mean, median and modal marks obtained by the students.

(ii) Also calculate 1st quartile and 3rd quartile and comment.

## Solution Q2: 


### **(a) Define central tendency. What are the important measures of central tendency? Which one is best and why?**

#### Central Tendency:
It is a statistical measure that identifies a single value representing the center of a data set. It indicates where most data points cluster.

#### Important Measures:
1. **Mean**: The arithmetic average of the data.
2. **Median**: The middle value when the data is arranged in order.
3. **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value.

#### Best Measure:
- The **best measure** depends on the data type and distribution:
  - **Mean** is best for symmetric, continuous data with no outliers.
  - **Median** is ideal when there are outliers, as it is unaffected by extreme values.
  - **Mode** is useful for categorical data or identifying the most common occurrence.

### **(b) Frequency Table Analysis**

#### Given Data:
| Marks   | Frequency (f) |
|---------|---------------|
| 0–15    | 2             |
| 15–30   | 4             |
| 30–45   | 10            |
| 45–60   | 20            |
| 60–75   | 9             |
| 75–90   | 5             |

(i) **Calculate Mean, Median, and Mode**  
(ii) **Calculate the 1st Quartile (Q1) and 3rd Quartile (Q3)**  

Let me calculate these values.

#### Calculations:

(i) **Mean, Median, and Mode:**



- **Mean**: \( 51.0 \)
- **Median**: \( 51.75 \)
- **Mode**: \( 52.14 \)

(ii) **1st Quartile (Q1) and 3rd Quartile (Q3):**
- **Q1 (25th Percentile)**: \( 39.75 \)
- **Q3 (75th Percentile)**: \( 62.5 \)

---

### **Comments:**
1. **Central Tendency**:
   - The values for the mean, median, and mode are close, indicating the data distribution is nearly symmetrical.
   - Mode is slightly higher, showing that the most common scores are concentrated in the 45–60 range.

2. **Quartiles**:
   - Q1 (39.75) indicates that 25% of students scored below this value.
   - Q3 (62.5) indicates that 75% of students scored below this value.
   - The interquartile range (\( Q3 - Q1 \)) is \( 62.5 - 39.75 = 22.75 \), reflecting the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
