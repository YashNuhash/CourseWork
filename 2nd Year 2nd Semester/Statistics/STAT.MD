## Question 5
(a) Define a normal distribution. Under what conditions binomial distribution tends to normal distribution. State some of its important properties.

(b) Suppose the daily wages of workers of a factory follows normal distribution with mean wage of Tk. 500 and standard deviation of Tk. 100.

(i) What is the percentage of workers getting daily wage between Tk.400 and Tk.650?
(ii) If the number of workers in that factory is 15000, how many workers get daily wage between Tk.400 and Tk.650.
(c) Given that A = 4.2, for a Poisson distribution, find

(i) PFX ≤ 2);

(ii) P[X≥ 5]; and

(iii) P[X=8]
